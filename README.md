# 💳 Credit Card Customer Segmentation (PCA & K-Means)

**Author:** Shokoufeh Naseri  
**Year:** 2024  

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **unsupervised learning** to segment credit card customers based on usage behavior.
Using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **K-Means clustering**, it identifies meaningful customer groups that support **marketing, risk analysis, and business strategy**.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – CC GENERAL Dataset  
- ~9,000 active credit card holders  
- 18 behavioral features (purchases, balance, cash advances, payments)

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation
- Median imputation for missing values  
- Removed non-numeric identifier (`CUST_ID`)  
- Standardized numeric features  
- Removed highly correlated variables  

---

## 📉 Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
- Reduced features from **17 → 10**
- First **6 principal components explain 83% of variance**
- Improved representation after removing correlated features

---

## 🧠 Clustering (K-Means)
- Optimal clusters selected using **Elbow Method**
- **K = 3** customer segments identified:

**Cluster 1 – Loan-Oriented Users**  
High balance and cash advances, low full payment rate  

**Cluster 2 – Active Spenders**  
High purchase frequency, low balance and cash advance  

**Cluster 3 – Low-Usage Users**  
Minimal activity across all features

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Removing correlated variables improves PCA performance  
- PCA + K-Means produces clear, interpretable segments  
- Results support customer profiling and targeted strategies

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **R**
- PCA
- K-Means Clustering
- Unsupervised Learning
- Data Visualization
